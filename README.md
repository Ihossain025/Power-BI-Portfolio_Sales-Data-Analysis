![Home Page](/Images/Our%20Superstore.jpg)

## Introduction & Project Overview ##

This Power BI dashboard was developed for a Sales Manager / Sales Department Head of a global retail Superstore to support data-driven decision-making across sales, product strategy, and customer management.

The project analyzes historical sales data to identify revenue trends, product performance, customer purchasing behavior, and regional sales patterns. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights that enable management to evaluate performance, identify growth opportunities, and optimize sales strategies at both a global and regional level.

Using Power BI, multiple interactive dashboards were designed to allow stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), perform drill-down analysis, and compare performance across time periods, product hierarchies, customer segments, and geographic regions.

The solution provides insights across the following key business areas:

📈 Sales Performance Analysis
Evaluation of overall sales growth, profitability trends, and seasonal patterns over multiple years.

🛍️ Product Performance Analysis
Identification of best- and worst-performing product categories, sub-categories, and individual products to support portfolio and pricing decisions.

👥 Customer & Segment Analysis
Analysis of customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) to understand their contribution to revenue and purchasing preferences.

🌍 Regional & Geographic Performance
Assessment of sales distribution across regions and states to highlight high-performing markets and regional demand variations.

## Data Structure / Model Overview ##


![Data Model](/Images/Data%20Model.jpg)

This is the model view of our dashboard. As you can see in the model, we have total 6 tables in the model: Customer table, Product table, Sales table, Order date table, Ship date table, and All Measure Table. However, In the original dataset, we had just one flat "Superstore sales Table". We have created separate "Customer Table" and "Product Table" to normalize the data. In addition, we have also created separate "Ship Date" and "Order Date" Table to avoid confusion or mismatch during Time Series Analysis. Then, we have built a Star Schema where all dimension tables relate to Fact Table (Sales Table) via 1-to-Many relationship, filter directing from dimension to fact table. "_All Measure" is a separate table which we have created to store our all measures in one place.   


## Dashboard Overview: Executive Summary / Key Insights ##

### Sales Insights ###

![Overall Sales Insights](/Images/Sales%20Insights_Overall.jpg)

This is the overall sales insights dashboard. It highlights key KPIs like Total orders, Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin. This also compares year-over-year Total Sales and Profit Growth. The Dashboard shows following insights: 

1. Revenue shows a strong upward trend from 2015 to 2017, after remaining relatively flat between 2014 and 2015. The largest year-over-year growth occurred between 2015 and 2016, indicating a turning point in sales performance and possible improvements in market demand, pricing, or sales strategy.

2. Profit increased consistently year over year, with growth rates of 24%, 33%, and 14% respectively. However, despite rising profits, the overall profit margin remains low at 2.89%, suggesting that costs are growing almost proportionally with revenue. This indicates limited pricing power or high operational/discount costs.

3. A clear seasonal sales pattern is observed across all years, with Q4 consistently generating the highest revenue, followed by Q3, Q2, and Q1. This suggests strong year-end demand, likely driven by holiday seasons and promotional campaigns, and highlights the importance of inventory and marketing planning ahead of Q4.

### Product Insights ###

![Overall Product Insights](/Images/Product%20Insights_Overall.jpg)

This is the overall product insights dashboard. It compares product categories and sub-categories as well as shows best and worst performing products in terms of total sales or revenue. The Dashboard shows following Insights: 

1. "Technology" is the highest revenue-generating product category, significantly outperforming "Furniture" and "Office Supplies". This indicates a strong customer demand for technology products and suggests that this category is a key driver of overall sales performance.

2. At the sub-category level, Chairs generate the highest revenue, followed by Phones, Storage, Tables, and Accessories. This highlights that high-value, durable goods contribute more to revenue than low-cost consumables, even if their sales volumes may be lower.
   
3. The "Cannon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier" is the top-performing product, followed by the "GBC Ibimaster 500 Manual ProClick Binding System" and the "HON 5400 Series Task Chair for Big and Tall". These products contribute disproportionately to revenue, indicating a reliance on high-ticket items.

In contrast, "PNY Rapid USB Car Charger – Black", "Grip Seal Envelopes", and "Acco Economy Flexible Poly Round Ring Binder" are among the lowest-performing products, likely due to lower price points, high competition, or limited differentiation.
  
4. A regional and year-specific analysis reveals significant variation in best- and worst-performing categories, sub-categories, and products compared to the overall dataset. This highlights the importance of localized and time-based analysis, as global averages can mask regional demand patterns and lead to sub-optimal business decisions.

   
### Consumer Insights ###

![Overall Consumer Insights](/Images/Consumer%20Insights_Overall.jpg)

This is the overall consumer insights dashboard. It demonstrates which consumer segment, region, and states contributing most to our revenue. It also reveals product preferences by segment and geography. Key Insights are described below: 

1. The dataset consists of three customer segments: Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. Among them, the Consumer segment contributes the highest share of total revenue, followed by Corporate and Home Office.

In terms of product preferences, the Consumer segment primarily purchases Furniture, followed by Technology and Office Supplies. In contrast, both Corporate and Home Office customers show a stronger preference for Technology products, with Office Supplies and Furniture ranking second and third, respectively. This indicates distinct purchasing behaviors across customer segments, emphasizing the importance of segment-specific product strategies.

2. From a geographic perspective, the West region is the highest revenue-contributing region, followed by East, Central, and South.

At the state level, California leads sales in the West, followed by Washington and Arizona. In the East, New York is the top-performing state, followed by Pennsylvania and Ohio. Texas dominates the Central region, with Illinois and Michigan as the next highest contributors, while North Carolina leads in the South, followed by Georgia and Virginia.

Across all regions, each product category generates a reasonable share of revenue, although their relative performance varies slightly by region. This highlights the importance of regional-level analysis rather than relying solely on global performance trends.

3. Analysis of shipping preferences shows that Standard Class is the most commonly used shipping mode, accounting for approximately 60% of all shipments. This is followed by Second Class (around 20%), First Class (around 15%), and Same Day Delivery (approximately 5%).

The dominance of Standard Class suggests that most customers prioritize cost efficiency over delivery speed, while faster shipping options are used selectively for time-sensitive orders.
